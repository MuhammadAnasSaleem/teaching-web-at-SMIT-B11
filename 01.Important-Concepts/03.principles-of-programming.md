# Basics Principles of Programming

- Problem solving
- Clean, readable and maintainable code
- Keeping It Simple

**[GOOD CODE](https://addyosmani.com/blog/good-code/) is like a love letter you pass to the next developer who will maintain it!** ðŸ’–

The principles of programming encompass fundamental concepts and guidelines that guide the development of software. Here are some key principles:

1. **Clean readability code**:

   This emphasize the readability, maintainability, and simplicity of code. This is the most crucial aspect of good programming.

2. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**:

   Think of programming like explaining something to a friend. You want to make it as simple as possible so they understand.

   This principle emphasizes simplicity in design and implementation. It suggests that systems should be as simple as possible to minimize complexity and potential errors.

3. **Documentation**: 

   Clear and concise documentation is essential for understanding how software works, its intended use, and its APIs. Good documentation enhances usability and facilitates collaboration among developers.
  
   This involves writing **English comments about your code that explain what it does**.

6. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: In programming, we avoid repeating the same instructions. Instead, we write them once and reuse them whenever needed.

   DRY encourages developers to avoid duplicating code by abstracting common functionalities into reusable components. This promotes code readability, maintainability, and reduces the risk of inconsistencies.

   - **Writing functions**: Write functions and automate repeated sections of code.
   - **Avoiding repetition**: Replace information that's likely to change with abstractions that are less likely to change.
   - **Using data normalization**: Avoid redundancy by using data normalization.
   - **Creating modular solutions**: Instead of copying logic from one file to another, create modular solutions.

7. **Modularity**: When you're solving a big problem, it's easier to break it down into smaller, manageable tasks. In programming, each part of your code should do one job well. This makes it easier to fix problems and add new features later.

   Picture each part of your code as a separate box. Each box does its own thing without interfering with the others. This makes it easier to understand and change one part without messing up the whole program.

   Breaking down a system into smaller, self-contained modules promotes maintainability, reusability, and ease of understanding. Each module should have a clear purpose and interface.

8. **Separation of Concerns**: In programming, we keep different parts of the code separate. This design principle involves breaking down larger tasks into smaller units, each responsible for one thing. This principle advocates for dividing a system into distinct sections, each addressing a separate concern. For example, separating user interface logic from business logic enhances modifiability and testability.

9. **Abstraction**: Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details behind a simplified interface. It allows developers to work at higher levels of understanding without needing to comprehend every detail of a system.

10. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, typically called a class. This hides the internal state of an object and only exposes necessary functionality through well-defined interfaces.

11. **Efficiency**: Efficiency refers to optimising code to ensure it runs as fast and uses as few resources as possible. Writing efficient code involves considering factors such as time complexity, space complexity, and algorithmic efficiency. As a result, efficient code leads to improved performance, reduced resource consumption, and better overall user experience.

12. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each module, class, or function should have only one reason to change. This principle promotes high cohesion and reduces coupling between components.

13. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that new functionalities should be added through extension rather than altering existing code.

14. **Dependency Injection**: Rather than hardcoding dependencies within a component, dependency injection involves passing dependencies as parameters. This promotes flexibility, testability, and easier maintenance.

15. **Testing**: Writing automated tests to validate the correctness of code is crucial for ensuring its reliability and maintainability. Test-driven development (TDD) and behavior-driven development (BDD) are popular methodologies that emphasize writing tests before writing code.

By adhering to these principles, developers can create software that is more robust, maintainable, and adaptable to change.
