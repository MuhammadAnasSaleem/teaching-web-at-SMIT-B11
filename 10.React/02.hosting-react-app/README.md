# Build Process

Building the project will convert all JSX into JS that can be deployed to any static hosting service.

1. To build the project, run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

1. The build files will be available in the `dist` folder.

1. If you have made other changes to the project, you have to run the build command again to update the build files. (This will delete the previous build files and create new ones.)

1. Preview the build files by running the following command:

   (ky build ky baad jo changes production per jaye gyi wo dekhne ke liye)
