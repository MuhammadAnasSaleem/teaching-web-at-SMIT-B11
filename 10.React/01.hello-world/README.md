# React Hello World

Now that you have a project in place, you can play around :)

Make sure to actually try these exercises. Even if they seem really simple. Even if you are 99% sure you know how to do it, prove it to yourself by typing it out and seeing the working result.

- Change the text “Hello World!” to say “Hello (your name)!”

- Bold your name by wrapping it in a `<strong>` tag. It works just like HTML.

- Inside the `<div>`, and under your name, add some other HTML elements. Headings, ordered and unordered lists, etc. Get a feel for how it works. How does it handle whitespace? What happens if you forget to close a tag?

- I mentioned that **you can put real JS code inside the JSX**. Try that out: inside the div, insert a JS expression surrounded with single braces, like `{5 + 10}`. (What happens if you try to use a multi-line expression?)

- Want to style it with CSS? Instead of using the “class” property like you would in HTML, use _“className”_. Then create a file `src/index.css` with the styles, and add the line `import "./index.css"` to the top of index.js. Yep, **you can import CSS into JS**. That’s Webpack working its magic behind the scenes.

And Hey! You’re making web pages like it’s 1995. Not too shabby for your first day!

Learning in bite-size chunks like this is way more effective at making the knowledge stick (versus learning everything and trying to remember it all)

Read a bit, then write some code to practice. Do this enough times, and you can master React pretty painlessly.
